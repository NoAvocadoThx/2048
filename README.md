Game 2048 is a well-know game and this project is my version of this game.
This is a UCSD CSE8b course project.
The project was created by Brandon Williams----Teaching Assistant of the course.
Some of the java files are given by Brandon, the rest are completed by me. There are headers for each file and each class and method within the files.
For detail description about each file, please refer to the description and header in each file.
Thanks!
